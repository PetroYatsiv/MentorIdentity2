Please add anotations for your models. Make them appropriate to your application requirements. 
For example: comment text cant be null, section description cant be null, etc.

In your models use the same naming conventions.
For example: In Section model you have a property SectionDescription, but in SubTopic and Topic models you have a property called Description. Which one to choose is up to you.

As I know, only users are able to add Sections, Topics, SubTopics, Comments. Cant find references in these models to user model.
